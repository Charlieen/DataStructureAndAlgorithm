Welcome back now Im not going to go over all of our steps that we used in the section where we talkedabout how to solve problems and how to talk through your problems in front of an interviewer.And we even watched Die google video of all the things you need to do because thats going to take waytoo long of a time.Im going to speed things up and just talk about the key points of how you would solve this problem.Well in order to reverse a string the first thing we want to do is some sort of check of our implant.We cant just assume that were going to always receive a string What if somebody calls the reversefunction with well undefined or with a number.What happens then.And a good thing to always start off with is to check the input.In my case Im going to do a simple check.Lets say that if theres no string.So that is undefined or perhaps that the string dot length is less than 2.That means well if string length is less than 2 that means Im just receiving one letter or no lettersin which case we dont really need to do any operations.Its already kind of reversed.And we can add different input validation here such as using the type of keyword in javascript to checkif its a string type.But thats something you can just do on your own.Actually lets implement it since were here anyway just to show you.So I can say type of string if it doesnt equal string type of SDR which is the parameter we receiveas an equal the string type.Well in that case we can just return.Thats not goodotherwise lets do some operation to reverse the string.Well lets think about this.We want to convert it into an array.So Im going to create a backwards array and this is what we are going to return from the function.Im going to return the array that is reversed but we want to return a string right.It reverses a string.This should return a string.Even though were going to convert whatever we receive into an array at the end we want to turn it backinto a string.So in javascript we can do the two string method or the joint method and we just say join all the itemsin the array.Now in here were going to grab the lenth of the array or the string because were going to be usingit a lot and we dont want to have repeated code.So Im going to say lenth minus one is how many items we have in the string.Or maybe we should name this itemsor actually total items.A better name.Now these total items.So were going to loop through our string will say let.He calls to the total items.So I is going to equal however many characters we have in our string and were going to keep going untilI is equals to zero.And all were going to do because we want to go from back to front.Were going to document this.So were going to go from the length of the string all the way back so were going to start off withI C R D and A and insert those into an array that weve created the backwards array one by one.So in this loop all were going to do is say backwards dont push each item that were going to create.So SDRand I know what youre thinking.Well well why dont we just convert the string into an array.You told me all about converting strings into an array and we didnt really do that.And javascript actually has the SDR dot split or we can run the split command to split things into anarray but with javascript we can actually just use strings as arrays and access each property like thiswith Braque and notation so that the essentially our arrays.So we dont have to run any split commands.This also works and all were doing is were going backwards one by one and pushing each item of ourgiven string into our array.So if I console log here before we run the joint command the backwards array and Iran reverseand lets reverse the stringlets run this.And you may have noticed that this lenth didnt really come from anywhere it should be total items.So this is the total whoops total items.This is the problem with life coding.I tried to show that everybody makes mistakes even myself and its good because this way you think throughthe problem and these total items remember we want to keep going as long as I is greater than or equalto zero.So if I now run this hey look at that we have an array with all of our backwards items right in here.And you see here that the return value that we get is the backwards string that we receive because wejoined it at the end.Very cool.I hope you got that answer.Or maybe have a better answer than me because what I did hear is not necessarily the cleanest way anddepending on which programming language you use you might have built in methods that simplified thestep.Let me show you what I mean.In javascript for example we can use some built in methods that come with the race to just simplifythis whole thing and make our code a lot more readable.Lets create a new function and Im going to call thisreverse too and this reverse stew is going to once again receive some sort of an input.I wont do any input validation for this one.You can just assume that we can just copy and paste it here.But in here we can do a simple return statement.Grab the string run the split command because this time around were not going to access the eye likewe did up here.Were going to convert it into an array so that we can use a built in method that comes in javascriptarrays called reverse and this reverse does.While we just did.Here for us and now we just joined it at the end.So by using a built in method called reverse I avoided all this work.How nice is that.Lets see if that works.Im going to say reverse to going to run and look at that.Its still working.What about another solution.Again many different ways.And lets say the interviewer says is there a more modern cleaner way that you can make this functionand because in javascript there is the new iOS 6 syntax.You can even create a one line function call it reverse three thats going to take a string and itsgoing to do string dot split.And again do the exact same thing using every function this time around.And this should still work the exact same look at that.And if you want to get fancy you can again use a new feature of javascript which is destructuring ornot destructuring this is the spread operator.If I run this we no longer need the split.I can run this and I get the same thing.Again I just want to demonstrate to you that there are many different ways to solve a problem and aninterviewer is not going to reject you for a job just because you implemented it this way versus thisway.It depends on how you deliver your solution.And this is something that we talked about in our how to solve problems section how you want to talkthrough the problem explain to the interviewer why you did.And as long as you understand the pros and cons of each solution thats what makes a great engineer.Ill see in the next one.
